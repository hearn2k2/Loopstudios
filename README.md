This is my project for Frontend Mentor.

This is the first ever attempt at coding a project on my own. I have used a variety of resources to help get to my end result, (CSS-tricks, codepen, content creator CodeCoder, W3Schools, etc.) hence why there may be different styles used throughout. It was a learning experience, so using different variations to ahceive an outcome was just part of the learning process.
